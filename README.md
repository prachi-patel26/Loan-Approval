# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a simple classification project to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not, based on applicant details like income, dependents, education, employment status, property area, and more. The project uses a publicly available dataset and implements a Logistic Regression model.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

| Column Name        | Description                                                   |
|:-----------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Loan_ID            | Unique identifier for each loan application                   |
| Gender             | Applicant's gender                                            |
| Married            | Marital status                                                |
| Dependents         | Number of dependents (0, 1, 2, 3+)                            |
| Education          | Applicant's education level (Graduate / Not Graduate)         |
| Self_Employed      | Employment status                                             |
| ApplicantIncome    | Applicant's income                                            |
| CoapplicantIncome  | Co-applicant's income                                         |
| LoanAmount         | Loan amount applied for                                       |
| Loan_Amount_Term   | Term of loan in months                                        |
| Credit_History     | Applicant's credit history (1.0 = good, 0.0 = bad)            |
| Property_Area      | Type of property area (Urban / Semiurban / Rural)             |
| Loan_Status        | Loan approval status (Y = Approved, N = Rejected) *(Target)*  |

## 📝 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Replace categorical anomalies (e.g., '3+' in Dependents)
3. **Data Encoding**
   - Label Encoding for categorical variables
4. **Train-Test Split**
5. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
